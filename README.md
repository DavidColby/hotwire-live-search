# README

The code in this repository was written to accompany the guide originally published [here](https://www.colby.so/posts/instant-search-with-rails-6-and-hotwire).

The guide and this code base demonstrate a simple search-as-you-type interface built with Ruby on Rails and [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/).

To run this code locally, you'll need Ruby 2.7.2, Rails, and Yarn installed on your machine. 

Once you've got those tools installed and cloned the code to your local machine:

1. rails db:create db:migrate
1. rails s
1. Visit [http://localhost:3000/players](http://localhost:3000/players) in your browser.

Need help getting things working? Have questions? Feel free to get in touch, you can find my contact info at the bottom of the guide linked above.
